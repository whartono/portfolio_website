Positioning CSS Stuff
Static:     Just the default positioning

Relative:   Positions the element in the requested way (top: 10px) from where 
            it would normally be if statically positioned. Ignores other workflow elements. (takes out of document flow)
            Often used in parent classes to create a 'container' so the other elements inside cannot go out of it
            
Absolute:   Position the element in the requested way (top: 10px) from the origin.
            Origin can be changed if the parent container has a non-static position.
            Ignores other workflow elements (takes out of document flow)

Fixed:      Positions the element in the requested way from the origin.
            Origin CANNOT be changed and will stay in the same spot even when scrolling
            Used to make navigation bars
            
Sticky:     Positions the element similar to relative. However, upon scrolling past, it will
            "catch" on to the top of the screen and will become fixed.
            A mix of fixed and relative.

Display CSS STuff

BLock:      Takes up the entire width given to it and will force a newline above and below it.
            Will not have anything next to it. Div uses this natively

Inline:     Takes up only enough space to fit the content. CANNOT have height/width attributes. Span uses this natively

Inlineblock:Takes up only enough space to fit the content, BUT can have height/width attributes, unlike inline
            img uses this natively

None:       Takes content out of the work flow

Flex:       Takes the entire width given to it and has multiple properties that can be accessed using 
            align-items and justify-content, flex-wrap, and align-content
